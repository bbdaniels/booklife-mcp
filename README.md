# BookLife MCP

**Your reading life, unified.** One MCP server that connects your library, reading tracker, and bookshelf into a seamless AI-powered reading assistant.

BookLife bridges [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app) (reading tracker), [Libby/OverDrive](https://libbyapp.com) (library access), and [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org) (metadata) so you can discover books, borrow from the library, track your reading, and get personalized recommendations -- all through natural conversation with Claude.

---

## Quick Start with Claude Code

If you use [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), you can add BookLife as an MCP server in one command:

```bash
claude mcp add booklife -- /path/to/booklife serve
```

Replace `/path/to/booklife` with the absolute path to your built binary (e.g. `~/.local/bin/booklife`). Set the required environment variable first:

```bash
export HARDCOVER_API_KEY="your-key-from-hardcover.app/settings/api"
```

Or pass it inline:

```bash
claude mcp add booklife -e HARDCOVER_API_KEY=your-key -- /path/to/booklife serve
```

That's it -- Claude Code will start the MCP server automatically when needed.

---

## Install

### From Source (requires Go 1.23+)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bbdaniels/booklife-mcp.git
cd booklife-mcp/booklife-mcp
make install
```

This builds the `booklife` binary and installs it to `~/.local/bin/booklife`. Make sure `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH`.

Alternatively, build without installing:

```bash
cd booklife-mcp/booklife-mcp
go build -o booklife ./cmd/booklife
```

### Verify

```bash
booklife version
```

---

## Setup

### 1. Connect Libby

```bash
# Get your clone code from Libby app:
# Settings → Copy To Another Device → Sonos Speakers
booklife libby-connect <8-digit-code>
```

### 2. Configure

Create `booklife.kdl` (default location: `~/.config/booklife/booklife.kdl`):

```kdl
server {
    name "booklife"
    version "0.1.0"
    transport "stdio"
}

providers {
    hardcover enabled=true {
        api-key env="HARDCOVER_API_KEY"
        endpoint "https://api.hardcover.app/v1/graphql"
    }

    libby enabled=true {
        notifications {
            hold-available true
            due-soon-days 3
        }
    }

    open-library enabled=true {
        endpoint "https://openlibrary.org"
        covers-endpoint "https://covers.openlibrary.org"
    }
}
```

### 3. Add to Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "booklife": {
      "command": "/path/to/booklife",
      "args": ["serve", "--config", "/path/to/booklife.kdl"],
      "env": {
        "HARDCOVER_API_KEY": "your-key-from-hardcover.app/settings/api"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Install the Claude Code Plugin (Optional)

For enhanced Claude Code integration with skills and slash commands:

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/andylbrummer/andy-marketplace

# Install the plugin
/plugin install booklife@andy-marketplace
```

See the [BookLife plugin in andy-marketplace](https://github.com/andylbrummer/andy-marketplace/tree/main/plugins/booklife) for details.

## Features

### Library Access (Libby/OverDrive)
Search your library catalog, check availability, place holds on ebooks and audiobooks, track loans and due dates — all without opening the Libby app.

### Reading Tracker (Hardcover)
Manage your reading list, update progress, rate books, and maintain your reading history on Hardcover through natural language.

### Unified TBR Management
A single to-be-read list that aggregates books from Hardcover (want-to-read), Libby (holds and tags), and manually added physical books. Filter by source, search, and prioritize.

### Comprehensive Sync
One-command sync that chains: import Libby loans → mark returned books as "read" in Hardcover → enrich metadata → cache Libby tags. Incremental, with dry-run preview.

### Content-Based Recommendations
Enriches your reading history with themes, topics, and mood data from Open Library and Google Books, then finds similar books based on what you've enjoyed.

### Reading Profile & Analytics
Automatic analysis of your reading patterns: format preferences, top genres, favorite authors, reading cadence, streaks, and completion rates.

### Progressive Discovery
Built-in `info` tool with workflow guides, category browsing, and detailed tool help. Never wonder what's available — just ask.
